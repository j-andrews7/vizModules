## Summary

Data visualization is central to modern data analysis, enabling
exploration of complex datasets, hypothesis generation, and
communication of results. `VizModules` is an R package that provides a
curated library of interactivity-first `shiny` \[@shiny\] modules for
common plot types, including scatter, bar, line, box, violin, density,
area, dot, histogram, pie, radar, heatmap, and more. Most modules render
interactive `plotly` \[@plotly\] graphics with input tooltips, hover
highlighting, draggable text and shape annotations, and one-click export
in multiple formats, while exposing the full aesthetic controls of the
underlying plot to users through a simple interface. This allows
generation of true publication-quality figures without writing code.
Each module has a consistent three-function interface, allowing
developers to embed it in any `shiny` application in \<10 lines of code.
Built on `dittoViz` \[@dittoViz\], `plotthis` \[@plotthis\], `ggplot2`
\[@ggplot2\], `plotly` \[@plotly\], and `ComplexHeatmap`
\[@ComplexHeatmap\], `VizModules` decouples plotting logic from data,
accepts inputs ranging from in-memory data frames to uploaded CSV, TSV,
and Excel files, and contains a multi-pane [“Figure
Builder”](https://j-andrews7-vizmodulesfigbuilder.share.connect.posit.cloud/)
for free-form composition and vector (SVG) export of complete figures,
itself a module that can be embedded in any application.

## Statement of need

Developers who want to build fully customizable, interactive plots in
`shiny` \[@shiny\] must implement input controls for every aesthetic,
reactive wiring between controls and plots, download handlers, and any
necessary interactive refinements. This process is time-consuming,
error-prone, and duplicated across projects, and it rarely produces a
consistent visual language within or between applications. However,
these efforts are necessary so that non-programmers such as bench
scientists, analysts, and domain experts are able to effectively explore
and visualize their data. These needs place a continual support burden
on computational staff and slow the path from data to insight.

`VizModules` addresses both problems with reusable, production-ready
visualization building blocks. For developers, it removes visualization
plumbing and provides a tested, uniform foundation that can be dropped
into existing applications or extended into specialized modules. For
non-programmers, it exposes comprehensive plotting and styling controls
and, for several modules, statistical testing, directly in the user
interface, enabling independent, reproducible data exploration and
figure generation. The target audience therefore spans software teams
building analysis platforms, analysts assembling bespoke dashboards, and
end users who need to visualize data without coding expertise.

## State of the field

R’s most common graphics packages (`ggplot2` \[@ggplot2\] for static
graphics and `plotly` \[@plotly\] for interactivity) provide developers
enormous flexibility but operate at a relatively low level. Teams must
still design and maintain the controls, layouts, and reactive logic for
every new `shiny` application. Several packages raise this floor, but
with goals distinct from `VizModules`.

`esquisse` \[@esquisse\] offers a drag-and-drop interface for building
individual `ggplot2` charts and exporting their code. It allows ad-hoc
creation of single, static plots, but it does not produce reusable
`shiny` modules, emphasize interactivity, or support composing multiple
coordinated visualizations within an application. `datamods`
\[@datamods\] provides polished `shiny` modules for importing,
validating, and filtering data. It is complementary to `VizModules`,
which targets the visualization layer (and includes its own
data-filtering module) rather than data ingestion.

Framework-level tools take a heavier approach. `teal` \[@teal\] is a
full exploratory-analysis framework, originally developed for
clinical-trial reporting, in which applications are assembled from
analysis modules within the `teal` runtime. It is powerful but requires
adopting its application architecture and is oriented toward analysis
workflows rather than deep, per-plot aesthetic control. `periscope2`
\[@periscope2\] standardizes the scaffolding of `shiny` applications,
offering layout, logging, and generic download modules, but does not
provide a flexible library of visualization modules. `blockr`
\[@blockr\] enables no-code construction of data-analysis pipelines by
wiring together “blocks” into a directed acyclic graph, targeting
end-to-end visual programming rather than framework-agnostic modules
that can be dropped in to any `shiny` application.

`VizModules` occupies a distinct niche by offering a curated set of
interactivity-first, deeply customizable plotting modules that drop into
any `shiny` application. Full aesthetic control of each plot is handed
to the end user. This focus complements the tools above, as `VizModules`
modules can be embedded inside a `periscope2` shell, paired with
`datamods` importers, or used to prototype the visual components that a
`teal` or `blockr` deployment might later incorporate.

## Software design

`VizModules` adopts a modular architecture layered on established
plotting libraries. Every visualization exposes a trio of functions:
`*InputsUI()` for controls, `*OutputUI()` for the plot, and `*Server()`
for logic. This allows controls and outputs to be placed independently
within a layout, and ensures that data are supplied reactively and kept
decoupled from the plot.

To serve both app users and developers, the input functions accept
`defaults`, `hide.inputs`, and `hide.tabs` arguments that pre-fill or
hide controls without altering server logic, letting developers enforce
application-level defaults while reusing the same tested module.
Individual `defaults` entries may themselves be reactive, so a parent
application can drive a module parameter, including an explicit
group-to-color mapping, from its own state while the control remains
editable by the user. A
[`createModuleApp()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/createModuleApp.md)
factory turns any module trio into a complete application for simple
testing, and the same pattern provides a template for composing
higher-level “wrapper” modules that add domain-specific logic while
reusing a base module’s full functionality.

The package fully embraces `plotly` for interactivity, either converting
`ggplot2` objects via `ggplotly()` or constructing `plotly` figures
natively. In many cases where `ggplot2` conversion is imperfect,
`VizModules` applies targeted `plotly` refinements to preserve original
functionality. This enables the usage of existing plotting functions
that return `ggplot2` objects, and several modules are built on top of
`plotthis` \[@plotthis\] and `dittoViz` \[@dittoViz\] plot functions.
The module contract is not tied to one rendering backend, however: the
`ComplexHeatmap` module instead delivers sub-heatmap zoom and cell
hover, click, and selection through `InteractiveComplexHeatmap`
\[@InteractiveComplexHeatmap\] while exposing the same controls,
defaults, and download behaviour as the rest of the library. Manual
refinements such as dragged annotations and edited axis titles persist
when a plot is redrawn, so iterative work is not lost with each change.

`VizModules` is implemented primarily in R, with select JavaScript
components such as a custom `multiColorPicker` input for individually
mapping colors to discrete variable levels and a `multiDynamicInput` for
adding and removing rows of heterogeneous controls. Select inputs are
virtualized and searchable, so columns with tens of thousands of
distinct values remain usable. Documentation tooltips for plotting
functions are automatically extracted with `roclang` to attach detailed
descriptions to each control on hover. The `BoxPlot`, `ViolinPlot`,
`yPlot`, and `freqPlot` modules add an integrated statistics tab
supporting pairwise tests (Wilcoxon rank-sum and paired or unpaired
t-tests) and omnibus tests (Kruskal–Wallis and ANOVA), with bracket
annotations placed by an interval-packing algorithm, configurable
p-value adjustment, and per-facet or nested-group comparisons. The
scatter module fits any number of user-specified trend lines through an
extensible backend registry, with `lm`, `glm`, `loess`, and `nls`
supplied and additional backends registrable from user code. Finally,
helper functions collect each plot together with its underlying data
(limited to the rows actually drawn), the inputs used to generate it,
and any statistical results into a single downloadable archive at the
click of a button, supporting reproducibility and downstream editing.

## Research impact statement

`VizModules` is available on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VizModules/index.html),
actively maintained, well-documented with a `pkgdown`
[website](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/) and vignettes
(including clear guides to using modules in your own app, authoring new
modules, extending existing modules, statistical testing, data
filtering, and custom inputs), and covered by a `testthat` suite
spanning its plotting functions and internal helpers. The package also
ships three [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io), installable into a
project with
[`use_vizmodules_skills()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/use_vizmodules_skills.md),
that give coding agents the package’s conventions and a generated
inventory of every module’s input keys, covering app construction,
wrapper modules, and authoring new modules within the package. In paired
benchmarking, the app-building skill halved both token usage and wall
time relative to pointing an agent at the documentation, with no loss of
correctness. A hosted [module
gallery](https://j-andrews7-vizmodules.share.connect.posit.cloud/) and
[Figure Builder
application](https://j-andrews7-vizmodulesfigbuilder.share.connect.posit.cloud/)
let users evaluate every module and assemble multi-panel figures
complete with automatic panel labelling and single-file SVG export
directly in the browser.

The package is designed as a foundational layer enabling development of
more specialized modules. The base modules can be easily extended to
generate more complex modules that operate on specific data structures
or analysis outputs. By giving developers a tested, interactivity-first
visualization base and providing downstream users a code-free way to
explore and visualize their data, `VizModules` shortens the path from
raw data to production-ready applications and publication-quality
visualizations.

## AI usage disclosure

`VizModules` was developed with assistance from generative AI tools,
including GitHub Copilot and Claude Code (Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6-4.8, Opus
5), for code optimization, debugging, and documentation formatting. The
core architecture, module logic, and testing strategy were designed and
authored by the developers, and all AI-assisted contributions were
manually reviewed and tested. The Agent Skills bundled with the package
are maintained alongside the code they describe and are intended to make
such assisted use of `VizModules` accurate and efficient for others.
