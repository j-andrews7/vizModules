# Add reference lines to a plotly figure from Shiny inputs

Convenience wrapper that adds horizontal, vertical, and/or diagonal
lines to a plotly figure based on parsed Shiny input values.

## Usage

``` r
add_reference_lines(
  fig,
  hline.intercepts = NULL,
  hline.colors = NULL,
  hline.widths = NULL,
  hline.linetypes = NULL,
  hline.opacities = NULL,
  vline.intercepts = NULL,
  vline.colors = NULL,
  vline.widths = NULL,
  vline.linetypes = NULL,
  vline.opacities = NULL,
  abline.slopes = NULL,
  abline.intercepts = NULL,
  abline.colors = NULL,
  abline.widths = NULL,
  abline.linetypes = NULL,
  abline.opacities = NULL
)
```
