# Convert native cartesian axis titles to draggable annotations

Plotly's native axis titles can have their text edited interactively but
cannot be dragged to a new position. Faceted figures already render
their shared x/y axis titles as paper-anchored annotations (via
[`build_facet_annotations()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/build_facet_annotations.md)),
which the plot configuration makes both editable and draggable. This
helper brings the same behaviour to single-panel (non-faceted) figures
by replacing the native x/y axis titles with equivalent paper-anchored
annotations.

## Usage

``` r
axis_titles_as_annotations(fig)
```

## Arguments

- fig:

  A plotly figure object.

## Value

The plotly figure with single-panel axis titles converted to
paper-anchored, draggable annotations. Returns the figure unchanged when
it is faceted/split or has no axis titles.

## Details

The figure is first built with
[`plotly::plotly_build()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/plotly_build.html)
so that titles assigned via `layout()` (which are otherwise held in
`layoutAttrs` until build time) are consolidated into the layout. Any
pre-existing annotations (for example statistical brackets or facet
labels) are preserved, and the font already applied to each native axis
title is carried over to the corresponding annotation.

Multi-panel figures (faceting or `split.by`, detected by the presence of
secondary axes such as `xaxis2`/`yaxis2`) are returned unchanged, since
their shared titles are already draggable annotations.
