# Apply standard render-time margin layout to a plotly figure

The `renderPlotly` block in every plot module server applies the same
user-configurable margins. This helper extracts that block into one
call.

## Usage

``` r
apply_render_margins(fig, input)
```

## Arguments

- fig:

  A plotly figure object.

- input:

  Shiny input object. Expected to contain `margin.t`, `margin.b`,
  `margin.l`, and `margin.r`.

## Value

The plotly figure with margins applied.

## Examples

``` r
fig <- plotly::plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", mode = "markers")
input <- list(margin.t = 40, margin.b = 40, margin.l = 40, margin.r = 40)
apply_render_margins(fig, input)
