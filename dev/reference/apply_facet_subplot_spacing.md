# Apply custom subplot spacing to a faceted ggplotly figure

[`ggplotly()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/ggplotly.html) assigns
panel layout via plotly domain coordinates
(`fig$x$layout$xaxis*/yaxis*$domain`) rather than honouring the ggplot2
`panel.spacing` theme option. This helper rewrites those domains so that
each facet panel has a uniform size and the gap between panels is
exactly `spacing` (expressed as a fraction of the plot area, e.g.
`0.04`).

## Usage

``` r
apply_facet_subplot_spacing(fig, spacing = 0.04, ncol = NULL, nrow = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- fig:

  A plotly figure object (typically the result of
  [`ggplotly()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/ggplotly.html)).

- spacing:

  Numeric fraction of the plot area to leave between panels (default
  `0.04`). May be a single value applied to both directions, or a
  length-2 numeric vector `c(horizontal, vertical)` to control the gap
  between columns and rows independently. Must satisfy
  `horizontal * (ncol - 1) < 1` and `vertical * (nrow - 1) < 1`;
  otherwise the figure is returned unchanged.

- ncol:

  Optional integer. Number of facet columns. If `NULL` or `NA`, detected
  from the number of distinct x-axis domain starts.

- nrow:

  Optional integer. Number of facet rows. If `NULL` or `NA`, detected
  from the number of distinct y-axis domain starts.

## Value

The modified plotly figure with rewritten axis domains and remapped
paper-anchored annotations/shapes. Figures with a single panel (or no
layout) are returned unchanged.

## Details

In addition to the axis domains, any paper-anchored layout annotations
(e.g. facet strip titles) and shapes (e.g. strip backgrounds, panel
borders) are remapped through a piecewise-linear transform built from
the old and new domain intervals, so strip labels and panel borders move
with their panels. Annotations/shapes whose `xref`/`yref` is tied to an
axis (for example `"x"`, `"y2"`, or `"x2 domain"`) are left alone
because they follow the rewritten axis automatically.

The number of columns and rows can be supplied manually, or detected
automatically from the distinct x / y domain starts already present in
the ggplotly output.

## Examples

``` r
p <- ggplot2::ggplot(mtcars, ggplot2::aes(wt, mpg)) +
    ggplot2::geom_point() +
    ggplot2::facet_wrap(~cyl)
fig <- plotly::ggplotly(p)
apply_facet_subplot_spacing(fig, spacing = 0.05)
