# Apply statistical annotation shapes and annotations to a plotly figure

Appends the shapes and annotations from
[`create_stat_annotations()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/create_stat_annotations.md)
to an existing plotly figure's layout, raising the y-axis top when the
brackets need more room than the requested range gives them.

## Usage

``` r
apply_stat_annotations(fig, stat_result, y.min = NULL, y.max = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- fig:

  A plotly figure object.

- stat_result:

  List with `annotations`, `shapes`, and `y.max` as returned by
  [`create_stat_annotations()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/create_stat_annotations.md).

- y.min:

  Numeric or NULL; minimum y-axis value. If NULL, the existing y-axis
  range is preserved.

- y.max:

  Numeric or NULL; the maximum the caller asked for. The drawn top is
  the larger of this and the height the brackets need. If NULL, the
  figure's existing top is used for that comparison.

## Value

The modified plotly figure.

## Details

The axis is only ever raised, never lowered: a top asked for through
`y.max` (or already on the figure) is kept when it is above the
brackets, so turning statistics on cannot silently undo a y-axis maximum
the user chose. Reserve the room up front with
[`stat_bracket_y_max()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/stat_bracket_y_max.md)
and this becomes a no-op.

    stats_df = stats_df,
    fig = fig,
    df = example_iris,
    x = "Species",
