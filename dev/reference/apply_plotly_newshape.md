# Apply Plotly newshape styling from uniform Plotly inputs

Applies user-drawn shape styling to a Plotly figure using inputs from
[`uniform_plotly_inputs_ui()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/uniform_plotly_inputs_ui.md).
Updates the `newshape` layout property to style shapes drawn with
Plotly's drawing tools (rectangles, circles, lines, etc.) in the
modebar.

## Usage

``` r
apply_plotly_newshape(fig, input, isolate_fn = isolate)
```

## Arguments

- fig:

  A plotly figure object.

- input:

  Shiny input object containing shape styling fields: `shape.fill`,
  `shape.line.color`, `shape.line.width`, `shape.linetype`,
  `shape.opacity`.

- isolate_fn:

  Function to isolate reactive values. Defaults to
  [`shiny::isolate`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/isolate.html).

## Value

The modified plotly figure with updated `newshape` layout settings.

## Examples

``` r
fig <- plotly::plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", mode = "markers")
shape_input <- list(
    shape.fill = "#ff000030", shape.line.color = "#ff0000",
    shape.line.width = 2, shape.linetype = "solid", shape.opacity = 0.5
)
apply_plotly_newshape(fig, shape_input, isolate_fn = identity)
