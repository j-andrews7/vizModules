# Changelog

## VizModules 0.5.0.9000

### Improved/New Functionality

- [`createModuleApp()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/createModuleApp.md)
  now accepts a `data_list` entry that is a *list* of data frames rather
  than a single one, filtering and displaying only the primary table
  (`primary.table`, defaulting to the first) and passing companions
  through to the module untouched. Also gains `sidebar.width` for
  modules whose output needs more room.
  [`ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapApp()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapApp.md)
  is a thin wrapper around it again, rather than a bespoke app.
- The `ComplexHeatmap` module’s row and column split methods gained an
  **“Annotation”** option
  ([\#349](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/349)),
  grouping rows or columns by the values of one or more annotation
  columns instead of by a derived clustering. Several columns give
  nested slices; pairing it with clustering off is also the fast path,
  since no distance matrix is needed.
- The `ComplexHeatmap` module gained a **Filter** tab with
  expression-based row and column filters
  ([\#346](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/346)), so a
  specific set of features or samples can be plotted without the
  `dataFilter` module. Row filters see the matrix data frame; column
  filters see a synthetic `column` field plus any per-sample metadata
  joined via `column_key`. Filtering runs before everything else, so
  scaling, annotations, splits, and the source download all describe the
  filtered matrix.
  - Both `ComplexHeatmap` filter inputs are debounced by 700ms, so
    typing an expression does not redraw the heatmap once per keystroke.
    The “Adding a New Module” and “Building Custom Modules” vignettes
    document the pattern for free-text inputs generally.
- Each `ComplexHeatmap` annotation track gained its own **Label Side**
  and **Label Size** controls, and a **Show Legend** checkbox
  suppressing just that track’s legend (default on). Set it from
  `defaults` with a `show_legend` field on the
  `row_annotations`/`column_annotations` row.
- The `ComplexHeatmap` module’s row and column **“Annotation”** splits
  now honour a factor column’s level order, so a caller can choose the
  order the slices come out in (model families by ID rather than
  alphabetically, say) rather than having ComplexHeatmap sort the groups
  itself. Unused levels are dropped, since an empty slice is an error.
- The `ComplexHeatmap` output UI functions gained `fit.width` (default
  `TRUE`), scaling the widget’s panels to their container’s width on
  load ([\#350](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/350))
  rather than sitting at `InteractiveComplexHeatmap`’s fixed pixel
  widths until the resize handle is dragged. `width`/`width1`/`width2`
  become relative sizes; heights are untouched and the widget’s own
  resize controls still win afterwards. Pass `fit.width = FALSE` for the
  old fixed-width behaviour.
- Added
  [`heatmap_fit_width()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/heatmap_fit_width.md),
  the `fit.width` behaviour above as a standalone wrapper, for apps that
  call
  [`InteractiveComplexHeatmap::InteractiveComplexHeatmapOutput()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/InteractiveComplexHeatmap/man/InteractiveComplexHeatmapOutput.html)
  directly rather than going through the module.
- [`ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapApp()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapApp.md)
  now opens on `example_heatmap_matrix` paired with
  `example_heatmap_column_data`, so the column annotation, split, and
  filter features are usable out of the box.
- [`safe_eval_filter()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/safe_eval_filter.md)
  and
  [`validate_expression()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/validate_expression.md)
  gained a wider shared vocabulary: `grepl`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`,
  `substr`, `nchar`, `toupper`, `tolower`, `trimws`, `abs`, `round`, and
  `xor`. All are pure, so the sandbox is unchanged. The two functions
  previously carried duplicate copies of the allowlist and AST walker
  and now share one.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a multi-select dropping a deselection made from its value tags.
  [`viz_select_input()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/viz_select_input.md)
  reports on dropdown close for multi-selects, but removing a value via
  a tag’s x (or the clear-all x) never opens the dropdown, so the change
  was silently never sent: the control showed the value gone while the
  server kept the old selection. Affected every multi-select in the
  package; most visible on the heatmap’s annotation split, where
  removing a column left the old slices in place.
- Fixed default annotations in the `ComplexHeatmap` module failing to
  render their color pickers and annotation tracks on load. Initial rows
  in
  [`multiDynamicInput()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/multiDynamicInput.md)
  are now reported to Shiny during initialization before deferred DOM
  binding, omitted fields backfill from `row_spec`, and the module
  server resolves palettes immediately and disables output suspension
  for annotation color controls.
- Fixed `fit.width` doing nothing for a heatmap that is not on the
  active tab at page load. Such a widget measures zero wide, so there
  was nothing to scale against and the fit gave up, leaving it at
  `InteractiveComplexHeatmap`’s baked-in pixel width until the resize
  handle was dragged. The fit is now retried when the container is first
  laid out (opening the tab, typically) and stops watching once it
  lands. It also reports the new size back through the widget’s own
  resize inputs, so an app tracking the heatmap’s geometry server-side —
  to map a cursor back to a cell, say — is not left measuring against a
  layout that no longer exists.
- Fixed every module-hosted `ComplexHeatmap` heatmap silently never
  drawing. `InteractiveComplexHeatmap` keys its registry by
  `validate_heatmap_id()`, which rewrites each non-word character to
  `_`, so the guard added alongside the annotation fix above looked up
  the raw namespaced id (`mymod-heatmap-Heatmap`) against a key stored
  as `mymod_heatmap_Heatmap`, found nothing, and returned before
  `makeInteractiveComplexHeatmap()` could run. Every
  [`ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapServer()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapServer.md)
  instance was affected, since a module id always contains a `-`; the
  widget rendered its empty shell with no error or warning.
- Fixed the `ComplexHeatmap` module’s `compact = TRUE` widget (and any
  use of `output_ui_float = TRUE`) adding a ~10,000px horizontal
  scrollbar to the host app. `InteractiveComplexHeatmap` detaches the
  floating click/brush info panel onto `<body>` and parks it at
  `right: -10000px` while idle, which extends the *document’s*
  scrollable width – on every page of the app, not just the one holding
  the heatmap – and scrolling right revealed the parked panel stuck on
  “Retrieving from server… Don’t move mouse.”. The panel is now
  re-parked to the left, where it contributes no overflow, leaving the
  floating behaviour otherwise untouched.

### Documentation

- Added the `ComplexHeatmap_Heatmap` module and `dittoViz_freqPlot` to
  the README
  ([\#348](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/348)).
- Refreshed the skills for the 0.4.0 changes they had not picked up
  ([\#348](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/348)).
- The `quick-start`, `custom-modules`, and `adding-a-new-module`
  vignettes now point at the bundled agent skill that covers their
  material and at
  [`use_vizmodules_skills()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/use_vizmodules_skills.md)
  ([\#347](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/347)).
  Previously the skills were documented only in the README, so a reader
  of the vignettes had no idea one existed for what they were doing.

## VizModules 0.4.0

CRAN release: 2026-08-28

### New Modules

- Added a `freqPlot` module
  ([`dittoViz_freqPlotInputsUI()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/dittoViz_freqPlotInputsUI.md),
  [`dittoViz_freqPlotOutputUI()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/dittoViz_freqPlotOutputUI.md),
  [`dittoViz_freqPlotServer()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/dittoViz_freqPlotServer.md),
  [`dittoViz_freqPlotApp()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/dittoViz_freqPlotApp.md))
  wrapping \[dittoViz::freqPlot()\], for comparing the per-sample
  composition of a categorical variable across groups. Unlike the other
  modules it does not plot columns of the incoming data, it tabulates
  how often each level of the chosen variable occurs within each sample
  and plots those frequencies, one facet per level. The axis limits,
  statistics, point annotations and source download therefore all
  describe that summarised frequency table rather than the input rows.
  - Comes with a new `example_composition` demo dataset containing 1800
    simulated single-cell records over twelve donors nested inside two
    conditions (and crossed with two batches).
- Added a `ComplexHeatmap` module
  ([`ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapInputsUI()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapInputsUI.md),
  [`ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapOutputUI()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapOutputUI.md),
  [`ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapServer()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapServer.md),
  [`ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapApp()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapApp.md))
  wrapping \[ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap()\]. Unlike the other plotly-based
  modules, its interactive output is delivered via the
  `InteractiveComplexHeatmap` package (sub-heatmap zoom, cell
  hover/click/select). The incoming data frame is converted to a numeric
  matrix (user-selected columns, with an optional row-name column), and
  a curated subset of
  [`Heatmap()`](https://pwwang.github.io/plotthis/reference/Heatmap.html)
  parameters is exposed via UI inputs.
  - Row and column annotation tracks can be added on the “Annotations”
    tab dynamically. Row annotations come from extra columns in the
    input data frame; column annotations need a companion per-sample
    metadata table, supplied via
    `data = list(matrix = <data.frame>, column_annotations = <data.frame>)`
    instead of a plain data frame.
  - The interactive output can be split into independently-placed pieces
    —
    [`ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapMainOutputUI()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapMainOutputUI.md),
    [`ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapSubOutputUI()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapSubOutputUI.md),
    [`ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapInfoOutputUI()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapInfoOutputUI.md)
    — for apps that want the main heatmap, sub-heatmap, and click/brush
    info panel in separate layout locations.
    [`ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapOutputUI()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/ComplexHeatmap_HeatmapOutputUI.md)
    also has a `...` passthrough for
    `InteractiveComplexHeatmapOutput()`’s `layout`, `compact` (a
    smaller-footprint mode that drops the sub-heatmap panel and floats
    the click/brush info near the cursor), and other arguments.
  - Comes with a new `example_heatmap_matrix` (30 genes x 12 samples,
    with row-annotation columns) and `example_heatmap_column_data`
    (companion per-sample metadata, for column annotations) demo
    datasets.

### Improved/New Functionality

- The package now contains three agent skills under `inst/skills/`,
  installable into a project with the new exported
  [`use_vizmodules_skills()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/use_vizmodules_skills.md):
  `vizmodules-app` (wiring modules into an app),
  `vizmodules-custom-module` (building wrapper modules), and
  `vizmodules-new-module` (authoring a module in this package). They
  follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) `SKILL.md`
  convention, so GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, and
  compatible tools can discover them.
  [`use_vizmodules_skills()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/use_vizmodules_skills.md)
  gains a `client` argument (`"agents"` by default, or
  `"github"`/`"claude"`) to install into `.agents/skills/`,
  `.github/skills/`, or `.claude/skills/` as needed.
  - Benchmarked against the README’s LLM-instruction prompt over 18
    paired runs
    ([\#341](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/341)).
    Building an app the clear win - half the tokens (66k vs 123k) and
    40% of the wall time, with identical correctness. Wrapping a module
    was inconclusive, and authoring a module was cost-neutral. Every run
    in both arms passed every assertion, so the skills’ measured value
    is efficiency on lookup-heavy work rather than improved output.
  - Each skill carries the traps that cost benchmark runs real time:
    [`useShinyjs()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shinyjs/man/useShinyjs.html)
    being required in a hand-built app for `hide.inputs`/`hide.tabs` to
    work, pandoc being required by
    [`create_source_download_handler()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/create_source_download_handler.md),
    `stat.hide.ns` defaulting to `TRUE` so an enabled Stats tab can draw
    nothing, and
    [`shiny::testServer()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/testServer.html)
    being unable to drive a plotly output.
- The `dittoViz_yPlot` module gained an “Annotations” tab that
  highlights and labels individual jitter points, matching the
  `dittoViz_scatterPlot` module
  ([\#340](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/340)).
  - The annotation controls are now the exported helpers
    [`uniform_annotation_inputs_ui()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/uniform_annotation_inputs_ui.md)
    and
    [`reset_annotation_inputs()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/reset_annotation_inputs.md),
    so other modules that draw individual points can pick them up, and
    `dittoViz_scatterPlot` now uses them rather than its own copy.
  - `dittoViz_yPlot`’s jitter positions are now drawn from a fixed seed,
    so they no longer reshuffle on every rebuild. Selections and
    annotations therefore stay attached to the points they were made on,
    and a plot redrawn with the same settings is reproducible.
  - Box/lasso selections are now matched to their points by index rather
    than by coordinates, so a label survives the rebuild that the
    selection itself triggers. Selections are cleared when the plot’s
    structure changes (Y data, grouping, color, shape, facet or plot
    types), since the indices only describe the layout they were
    captured on.
- Every module can now be initialized with an explicit group-to-color
  mapping via `defaults`
  ([\#334](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/334)). Pass a
  named character vector under the module’s color input key,
  e.g. `defaults = list(palette.colours = c(setosa = "red", virginica = "#0072B2"))`,
  and the color picker is seeded with it.
  - Precedence runs picker \> `defaults` \> the module’s stock palette,
    so a plot can open on a specific palette while every color stays
    editable, and groups the mapping does not name still get a sensible
    default. Reset restores the supplied mapping rather than the stock
    palette.
  - Keys are `palette.colours` for most modules, `color.panel` for
    `dittoViz_scatterPlot`, `slice.colors` for `piePlot`, and
    `trace.colors` for `radarPlot`; the ungrouped single-color controls
    (`single.point.color`, `single.fill.color`, `single.color`) and the
    continuous palette selectors (`palette.name`, `gradient.palette`)
    are now seeded from `defaults` too. Since individual `defaults`
    entries may be reactive, a parent app can also drive the palette
    from its own state.
    [`resolve_palette()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/resolve_palette.md)
    gains a `manual_colors` argument implementing the layering.
- The figure builder now passes each panel’s `defaults` to the module
  server as well as to its inputs UI, so registry defaults can seed
  server-rendered controls such as the color picker.
- Source data downloads are now more robust and now limit to the data
  actually shown on the plot rather than the entire input dataframe.
  This makes download snappier and keeps plot source data contained,
  which is important for publication. The switch to `viz_select_input`
  (described below) also required some changes to handle empty
  vectors/`NULL` values appropriately.
- Individual `defaults` entries can now be a
  [`reactive()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/reactive.html) or
  [`reactiveVal()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/reactiveVal.html),
  letting a parent app drive a module parameter from its own state
  ([\#325](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/325)).
  Previously the only route was `update*Input()` from the parent, which
  is an asynchronous client round-trip and so re-rendered the plot twice
  per change (a visible flicker). Reactive defaults are resolved
  server-side in the same reactive flush as the data, so the plot
  renders once, while the on-screen control stays populated and
  user-editable. An external change takes precedence over a value the
  user has typed, and Reset restores the reactive’s current value. Adds
  the exported helper
  [`setup_reactive_defaults()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/setup_reactive_defaults.md);
  [`setup_auto_update_logic()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/setup_auto_update_logic.md)
  gains an optional `params` argument to consume its store, and
  [`get_default()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/get_default.md)
  now resolves reactive entries with
  [`isolate()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/isolate.html). Modules
  with purely static `defaults` are unaffected. Not supported for the
  scatter module’s compound `custom.models` input.
- Wired up `hover.data` and `hover.round.digits` in the `dittoViz_yPlot`
  module ([\#317](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/317)).
  When no columns are selected, the module reproduces
  [`dittoViz::yPlot()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/dittoViz/man/yPlot.html)’s
  default hover content, so existing plots are unchanged.
- The `dittoViz_yPlot` module’s “Y Data” input can now take several
  columns at once (selecting more than one previously errored while
  computing the y-axis range).
  - New “Multivar Aesthetic” and “Multivar Split Dir” controls on the
    Facet tab expose
    [`dittoViz::yPlot()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/dittoViz/man/yPlot.html)’s
    `multivar.aes`/`multivar.split.dir`, so the selected variables can
    each get their own facet (the default), sit side by side on the
    x-axis, or be mapped to the fill legend (in which case the colour
    picker keys off the variable names, since they are what is being
    coloured). The y-axis limits span every selected variable, the axis
    title drops the column name once it no longer describes the shared
    axis (keeping any adjustment, e.g. `log2(z-score)`), and the
    facet-specific handling (subplot spacing, boxplot dodging, shared
    axis titles) now also applies to variable facets.
  - Statistics are computed separately within each variable’s facet; the
    Stats tab is hidden for the “group” and “color” aesthetics, and when
    a `split.by` facet is combined with several variables, as
    significance brackets cannot be placed against those layouts without
    stuff getting hella complicated in ways the current stats
    implementation cannot yet handle. Ideally, this will be supported in
    the future but will take some thoughtful work to implement in a
    robust way.
- Every module select input is now a virtualised, searchable dropdown
  built on
  [`shinyWidgets::virtualSelectInput()`](https://dreamrs.github.io/shinyWidgets/reference/virtualSelectInput.html)
  ([\#330](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/330)).
  Previously a select fed by a high-cardinality column (e.g. `var` in
  `dittoViz_yPlot` on a genome-wide table) rendered every option,
  producing a dropdown that was both slow and impossible to pick from
  even with max options set. Only the visible slice is rendered now, so
  tens of thousands of options stay usable, and long lists gain a search
  box automatically. Adds the exported helpers
  [`viz_select_input()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/viz_select_input.md)
  and
  [`update_viz_select()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/update_viz_select.md)
  for use in custom modules. Three widgets deliberately stay native
  because client-side JavaScript reads them directly: the figure
  builder’s “Panel labels” menu,
  [`multiColorPicker()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/multiColorPicker.md)’s
  palette picker, and
  [`multiDynamicInput()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/multiDynamicInput.md)’s
  select rows.
- [`dataFilterServer()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/dataFilterServer.md)
  gains `filter.max.options` (default `50`), capping how many options a
  factor column’s DataTables filter dropdown renders at once. Typing
  still searches the full set. Note that DT serialises every level of a
  factor column into the page regardless, so `factor.char.cols = TRUE`
  remains a poor fit for columns with very many distinct values.
- The `dataFilter` table’s controls now sit on a single row for better
  use of space. With `col.visibility = TRUE` the module used DataTables’
  `Blfrtip` layout, which stacks the “Columns” button, the page-length
  select and the search box in three full-width blocks, wasting three
  rows of vertical space above the table. They now share one flex row
  with the search box aligned to the far end, styled by CSS the module
  ships itself.
- Tweaked
  [`multiColorPicker()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/multiColorPicker.md)
  layout slightly for easier tetrising into compact UIs. Elements should
  now reflow more appropriately to prevent label/control overlaps in
  narrow contexts.
- [`multiColorPicker()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/multiColorPicker.md)
  no longer reports a value for every step of a colour choice, so a
  dependent plot is rebuilt once per colour rather than dozens of times.
  A group’s swatch is a native `<input type="color">`, and the browser’s
  colour dialog previousl fired an event for each drag or click inside
  it (Chrome fires `change` just as often as `input`, rather than only
  on close). Now, the value is only reported when the input loses focus
  or the user moves the mouse outside it, preventing most unnecessary
  re-renders. Typing in a hex field is coalesced until the user pauses
  instead, while one-shot actions, i.e. palette swatches, “Apply”,
  “Reset”, selecting another group, and a hex code committed with Enter
  or by clicking away, still report immediately.
- Added ability to show/hide columns in the `dataFilter` module with
  DataTables’ built-in column visibility controls. This is useful for
  hiding columns that are not relevant to the user, or for hiding
  columns that are used for internal logic but not meant to be
  displayed. The `hide.columns` argument can be used to specify which
  columns to hide by default (by name or position), which also removes
  their filter boxes for a simpler interface, and
  `col.visibility = TRUE` adds a “Columns” button so users can toggle
  visibility via the DataTables UI. Hiding is display-only: hidden
  columns are still present in the returned filtered data, so downstream
  plotting modules can use them. The name/position lookup behind
  `hide.columns` is exposed as the new exported helper
  [`resolve_column_targets()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/resolve_column_targets.md),
  which turns column names into the zero-based `targets` indices any
  hand-rolled \[DT::datatable()\] `columnDefs` entry needs.

### Deprecations and Removals

- Removed the `manual.colors` argument from
  [`dittoViz_scatterPlotServer()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/dittoViz_scatterPlotServer.md).
  It was the only module with such an argument, and it hard-overrode the
  color picker, so the colors it supplied could not be edited. Pass the
  same named vector as `defaults = list(color.panel = ...)` instead,
  which every module now understands and which leaves the colors
  editable.

### Bug Fixes

- Corrected two documentation errors that would mislead anyone following
  the vignettes. `quick-start`, `defaults-and-hiding`, and
  `custom-modules` all used `defaults = list(main = ...)` as the worked
  example for reactive defaults, but no module exposes a plot title:
  every server passes `main = NULL` and none reads `input$main`, so the
  example was a silent no-op. The examples now use `color.by`, which
  modules do read, and the reactive-defaults sections note that an
  unrecognised key is silently ignored by
  [`get_default()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/get_default.md).
  Separately, `custom-modules`’ “Hiding Base Module Inputs” example
  passed `hide.inputs` to `*InputsUI()`; that argument belongs to
  `*Server()`, and since no `*InputsUI()` accepts `...` the example
  failed with an unused-argument error. Found while benchmarking agent
  skills against the docs
  ([\#341](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/341)).

- Every module server (and
  [`dataFilterServer()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/dataFilterServer.md))
  now requires its `data` reactive to yield a data frame: values that
  are not data frames are coerced with
  [`as.data.frame()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.data.frame.html), and a
  `NULL` makes the module wait for data rather than error. A parent app
  that briefly emits `NULL` can no longer take a plot down with it.

- Fixed modules rendering their plot two or three times for a single
  change (somewhat related to
  [\#325](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/325)). Several
  modules compute a value on the server and push it into one of their
  own inputs with `update*Input()`, which is an asynchronous client
  round-trip: the plot rendered once with the stale value and again when
  the client echoed the new one. On load `dittoViz_yPlot` did this three
  times over (y-axis range, stat comparison pairs, and the rebuilt
  `multiColorPicker`).

  - These inputs are now wrapped in
    [`freezeReactiveValue()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/freezeReactiveValue.html)
    so dependents pause until the new value lands, giving a single
    render. This still applies to `stat.pairs` (`dittoViz_yPlot`,
    `plotthis_BoxPlot`, `plotthis_ViolinPlot`) and `facet.scale`
    (`plotthis_BoxPlot`). The colour picker and the y-axis range were
    handled this way too at first; both have since moved to a
    server-side store, for the reasons in the
    [\#338](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/338) entry
    below.
  - Added a section in the “Adding a New Module” vignette describing
    this pattern.

- Fixed an initialization bug in
  [`multiColorPicker()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/multiColorPicker.md)
  due to string indexing rather than position, leading to out of bounds
  errors when a group label was an empty string.

- Fixed the `dittoViz_yPlot` module re-rendering its plot when the user
  merely switched to the Data tab. The colour picker is built by a
  [`renderUI()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/renderUI.html) on that
  tab, and Shiny suspends an output whose tab is hidden, so a change to
  the palette’s groups (setting “Multivar Aesthetic” to “color”, say,
  which keys the palette by variable name) could not rebuild the picker
  when it happened. The rebuild waited for the tab to be opened, and the
  value it reported then re-rendered the plot for what was only a tab
  click. The plot now depends on the *resolved* palette, the
  group-to-colour mapping it actually draws with (held in a
  [`reactiveVal()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/reactiveVal.html)),
  rather than on the picker’s raw value. A rebuilt picker re-seeded from
  that same resolution therefore changes nothing to re-render for, while
  a colour the user actually picks comes straight through.

- Fixed every module that uses
  [`multiColorPicker()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/multiColorPicker.md)
  rendering its plot an extra time on initialization, and again the
  first time the user opened the tab the picker lives on
  ([\#338](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/338)). The
  plot depended on the picker’s raw `input$<key>`, which is `NULL` until
  the browser binds the widget and reports back — so the echo of a
  mapping the server had just seeded the picker with still counted as a
  change and rebuilt the plot. An attempt utilizing
  [`freezeReactiveValue()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/freezeReactiveValue.html)
  to guard didn’t work: inside a
  [`renderUI()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/renderUI.html) it pauses
  only the readers that run after it in the same flush, and at startup
  the plot output runs first, so the freeze landed too late to pause
  anything.

  - Every module now reads a server-resolved palette instead. The new
    exported helper
    [`setup_group_colors()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/setup_group_colors.md)
    resolves the group-to-colour mapping as soon as the group set is
    known and holds it in a
    [`reactiveVal()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/reactiveVal.html),
    which only invalidates on a real change. A rebuilt picker echoing
    the palette already in use costs nothing, while a colour the user
    picks comes straight through. `piePlot` and `radarPlot`, which had
    no guard at all, are covered for the first time.
  - The picker’s palette dropdown no longer carries an HTML `id`.
    Shiny’s select binding claims every `<select>` with one, so each
    picker was quietly registering a stray
    `input[["<inputId>-palette"]]` alongside its own value. The widget’s
    JavaScript and CSS both find that element by class, so nothing
    needed the id.
  - The “Adding a New Module” vignette’s “Updating Your Own Inputs From
    the Server” section now documents this pattern for
    [`renderUI()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/renderUI.html)-rebuilt
    widgets.

- The y-axis limits now leave more room for significance brackets, and
  no longer cost an extra render on the way in. The plot read the raw
  `input$y.min`/`input$y.max`, which the module had just pushed to the
  browser, so their echo rebuilt it — the same
  [`freezeReactiveValue()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/freezeReactiveValue.html)
  that could not cover the colour picker was covering these no better.

  - `dittoViz_yPlot`, `plotthis_BoxPlot`, `plotthis_BarPlot` and
    `plotthis_ViolinPlot` now read a server-side store, the new exported
    [`setup_axis_range()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/setup_axis_range.md),
    so the echo of a limit the module itself set changes nothing while a
    limit the user types comes straight through. Startup drops a render
    in each.
  - Brackets are stacked above the data, and nothing had reserved room
    for them: the axis was silently rescaled at draw time to whatever
    they needed. Worse, that rescale was applied as an assignment rather
    than a maximum, so enabling statistics *shrank* a y-axis maximum the
    user had deliberately set — a plot limited to 0-20 was pulled back
    to the top of the brackets.
    [`apply_stat_annotations()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/apply_stat_annotations.md)
    gains a `y.max` argument and now only ever raises the top, never
    lowers it.
  - The new exported
    [`stat_bracket_y_max()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/stat_bracket_y_max.md)
    works out how high the brackets will reach, and the three modules
    that draw them reserve that room up front, so the `y.max` control
    shows the limit actually in use. It shares the bracket packing with
    the drawing code, so the two agree exactly, and it honours `hide.ns`
    (on by default) rather than reserving room for brackets that are
    never drawn.

- Fixed the `dittoViz_yPlot` reset button calling
  [`updateCheckboxGroupInput()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/updateCheckboxGroupInput.html)
  on its “Plots” select, so resetting left the plot type selection
  untouched.

- Fixed axis titles not reflecting applied data adjustments in the
  `dittoViz_yPlot`, `dittoViz_scatterPlot`, and `linePlot` modules
  ([\#321](https://github.com/j-andrews7/VizModules/issues/321)). The
  annotation-persistence feature added in 0.3.0 was re-applying the
  previously captured title text on every rebuild, clobbering the
  freshly generated adjustment-aware label (e.g. `log2(units)`). Axis
  titles carrying an active adjustment are now always regenerated, while
  a manually edited title with no adjustment still persists and the
  dragged title position persists in all cases.
  [`finalize_manual_edits()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/finalize_manual_edits.md)
  gains a `regen_keys` argument to drive this. Axis titles are also
  regenerated (rather than persisted) when the plotted variable for that
  axis changes, via the new exported helper
  [`reset_axis_title_text()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/reset_axis_title_text.md),
  since a manual title only makes sense for the variable it was written
  for. Shared axis titles in faceted `linePlot`/`dumbbellPlot` figures
  (built via
  [`build_facet_annotations()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/build_facet_annotations.md))
  are now tagged as axis annotations so their dragged position survives
  label changes; as a result they now pick up the axis-title font
  settings rather than the facet-title font settings.

- The main plot title is now blank by default in the `dittoViz_yPlot`
  and `dittoViz_scatterPlot` modules (previously dittoViz’s
  `main = "make"` auto-generated a title from the variable name and
  regenerated it on every re-render). Users can still add a title
  interactively by editing it on the plot.

## VizModules 0.3.0

CRAN release: 2026-07-27

### New Modules

- Turned the Figure Builder into a reusable, namespaced Shiny module
  ([`figureBuilderUI()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/figureBuilderUI.md)
  /
  [`figureBuilderServer()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/figureBuilderServer.md)),
  so it can be embedded inside a larger app and instantiated more than
  once, just like the plot modules.
  [`figureBuilderApp()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/figureBuilderApp.md)
  is now a thin wrapper around this module and keeps its existing
  behaviour. The canvas CSS/JS was made namespace-safe (class-based,
  per-instance) so multiple builders can coexist on one page.
  - Panel labels (a, b, c …) now render live on the canvas as soon as
    they are chosen from the “Panel labels” menu (and renumber as panels
    are added, removed, or dragged), instead of only appearing in the
    exported SVG.
  - Moved the Figure Builder app into an exported
    [`figureBuilderApp()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/figureBuilderApp.md)
    function so it can be launched directly
    ([`figureBuilderApp()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/figureBuilderApp.md)),
    seeded with custom datasets via `data_list`, extended with custom
    modules via `module_registry`, and returned either as a
    [`shinyApp()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/shinyApp.html) object
    or as separate `ui`/`server` components
    (`return_components = TRUE`). The bundled `inst/apps/figure-builder`
    app is now a thin wrapper around this function.
  - Added to Gallery App.

### Improved/New Functionality

- Facet/split selectors across all modules now only offer valid faceting
  variables. Faceting (or splitting) is restricted to **categorical
  columns** (character or factor) with **fewer than 50 unique values**;
  numeric columns and high-cardinality categoricals are no longer
  selectable, preventing accidental creation of an unwieldy number of
  panels. This is powered by a new internal helper, `.facet_check()`,
  whose output populates the facet/split input choices.
- Simplified boxplot outlier hiding to rely on native plotly
  `boxpoints = FALSE` behaviour (via ggplot2’s `outlier.shape = NA` in
  the `plotthis_BoxPlot` module and
  [`dittoViz::yPlot`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/dittoViz/man/yPlot.html)’s
  `boxplot.show.outliers` argument in `dittoViz_yPlot`), rather than
  post-hoc marker manipulation. Removed the now-unused internal helper
  `.remove_boxplot_outliers()`. This is more robust with plotly 4.12.0+.
- Added a new reusable custom Shiny input,
  [`multiDynamicInput()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/multiDynamicInput.md)
  (with
  [`updateMultiDynamicInput()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/updateMultiDynamicInput.md)),
  that lets users dynamically add and remove rows of heterogeneous
  inputs. Each row is described by a generic `row_spec` (a named list of
  field specs using either a `type` alias — `select`, `text`, `numeric`,
  `slider`, `checkbox`, `colour` — or an arbitrary input constructor via
  `fn`), a `+ Add` button appends rows, each row has an `X` delete
  button, and fields wrap to a new line after `max_per_row` (default 4).
  The value returned to the server is a named list of rows (`model1`,
  `model2`, …), each a named list keyed by the field names. Add/delete
  are handled client-side, and values are read back generically via each
  field’s registered Shiny input binding, so any input type is
  supported.
  - Added vignette `vignette("using-custom-shiny-inputs")` documenting
    [`multiDynamicInput()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/multiDynamicInput.md)
    usage: row_spec definition, pre-filling with `elements`, reading
    values, and server-side updates.
- Added generic modeling capabilities to `dittoViz_scatterPlot module`.
  The module’s custom-model feature now supports **multiple** models at
  once via
  [`multiDynamicInput()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/multiDynamicInput.md):
  add as many rows as you like, each with its own model type
  (`lm`/`glm`/`loess`/`nls`), formula, line colour, and line width, and
  every valid model is fitted against the active (filtered) data and
  overlaid as its own line (respecting faceting). Formulas are validated
  by the internal `.safe_build_model()` helper to ensure safety.
  - This includes the ability to add custom model backends via
    [`register_model_backend()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/register_model_backend.md),
    [`get_model_backend()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/get_model_backend.md),
    [`list_model_backends()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/list_model_backends.md),
    and
    [`build_model_row_spec()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/build_model_row_spec.md).
    Backends declare a `fit` function, a `predict` function, validated
    output classes, and optional extra UI `fields` that appear/hide
    dynamically based on the selected model type. The four built-in
    backends (lm, glm, loess, nls) are registered automatically at
    package load. Extra UI fields from backends are forwarded to `fit()`
    via `...`.
  - Added vignette
    [`vignette("custom-model-lines")`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/articles/custom-model-lines.md)
    documenting the model backend registry: how the pipeline works,
    setting model defaults, registering custom backends (with drc and
    mgcv examples), and how extra fields flow through to the fit
    function.
- Pass `defaults`, `hide.inputs`, and `hide.tabs` arguments to the
  module app factory functions in all module app wrappers, so that users
  can pre-fill or hide controls when testing modules in isolation.
- More intelligent input hiding logic so that when individual inputs are
  hidden (via `hide.inputs` or dynamically in response to other inputs),
  the remaining controls reflow to fill the space and no empty gaps are
  left in the UI. Input grids are now laid out with a wrapping flexbox
  container via
  [`organize_inputs()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/organize_inputs.md).
  Optional elements are handled gracefully.
- Added continuous color-scale trimming controls (“Lower Quantile”,
  “Upper Quantile”, “Lower Cutoff”, and “Upper Cutoff”) to the
  `plotthis_DotPlot`, `plotthis_BarPlot`, and `plotthis_SplitBarPlot`
  modules, exposing the new
  `lower_quantile`/`upper_quantile`/`lower_cutoff`/`upper_cutoff`
  arguments from plotthis 0.13.0. These controls appear only when the
  selected fill column is numeric.
- Added dot border controls (“Border Color” and “Border Size”) to the
  `plotthis_DotPlot` module, exposing the new `border_color` and
  `border_size` arguments from plotthis 0.13.0. `border_color` is
  limited to a single constant color in the module UI.
- Updated the `plotthis_DotPlot` “Fill Cutoff” control to pair a numeric
  value with a new “Fill Cutoff Direction” selector (`<`, `<=`, `>`,
  `>=`), matching plotthis 0.13.0’s string-expression `fill_cutoff`
  (e.g. `"< 18"`).
- Added annotation persistence, i.e. annotation positions persist when
  the plot is re-rendered. This extends to axis/facet titles and custom
  annotations, which means much less finagling during iterative editing.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed broken input hiding when using `hide.inputs` and `hide.tabs`
  arguments in module app wrappers due to lazy UI injection via
  `renderUI`, which effectively overwrote the `hide` calls. `renderUI`
  also re-renders the input UIs every time a dataset changes - now if
  the dataset changes, the inputs are re-rendered but the `hide` calls
  are re-applied to maintain the hidden state.
- Fixed an error in `plotthis_SplitBarPlot` where the categorical text
  position input was not respected if the axes were flipped. Now the
  text position input is respected regardless of axis orientation.
- Export numerous internal helper functions for use in custom modules,
  particularly those related to axes, faceting, and layouts. It became
  apparent these were necessary as initial work began on
  `sciVizModules`.
- Fixed a bug in `dittoViz_yPlot` where plot selection and outlier
  hiding were not respected appropriately due to a typo in the
  `boxplot.show.outliers` input name.
- Fixed a bug in `dittoViz_scatterPlot` where 2 `split.by` inputs caused
  an error due to improper checks for empty strings on a vector of
  elements.
- Fixed a bug in `dittoViz_scatterPlot` where highlight aesthetics
  weren’t applied when a categorical x-axis was used.

### Deprecations and Removals

- Removed `ternaryPlot` module, as it is just a bad plot that’s
  impossible to actually interpret or really utilize effectively.

## VizModules 0.2.0

CRAN release: 2026-06-16

- Created the Figure Builder app so that users can dynamically construct
  multi-panel figures using different data sets and plot types on a
  single page. Allows for full page SVG export, source data dump
  organized per panel, and full customization of plot position and size.
- All `*OutputUI()` functions gained a `resizable` argument (default
  `TRUE`). When `FALSE`, the plot output is no longer wrapped in
  [`shinyjqui::jqui_resizable()`](https://yang-tang.github.io/shinyjqui/reference/Interactions.html),
  which avoids a redundant resize handle when the output is embedded in
  a container that already provides resizing (such as the Figure Builder
  app cards).
- Added a new `plotthis_DotPlot` module
  ([`plotthis_DotPlotInputsUI()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/plotthis_DotPlotInputsUI.md),
  [`plotthis_DotPlotOutputUI()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/plotthis_DotPlotOutputUI.md),
  [`plotthis_DotPlotServer()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/plotthis_DotPlotServer.md),
  and the
  [`plotthis_DotPlotApp()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/plotthis_DotPlotApp.md)
  convenience wrapper) that wraps
  [`plotthis::DotPlot()`](https://pwwang.github.io/plotthis/reference/dotplot.html)
  for interactive dot plots, including a custom dot-size legend since
  plotly still lacks that capability.
- Added the `example_markers` dataset, a simulated single-cell
  marker-gene expression table (immune cell types × marker genes) used
  as the default example data for the DotPlot module.
- Added “Source Data” download button at the bottom of every module’s
  control panel. The button creates and downloads a ZIP file containing
  a self-contained HTML of the plotly plot, a CSV of the plot data
  (retrieved via
  [`plotly::plotly_data()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/plotly_data.html)),
  and for modules with statistics enabled (Box / Violin / yPlot), a
  table of the statistics info. Source downloads are now built from the
  exported
  [`collect_source_data()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/collect_source_data.md)
  and
  [`create_source_download_handler()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/create_source_download_handler.md)
  helpers, and each module server returns its source reactive so it can
  be reused (e.g. by the Figure Builder). Given source data is now
  required by many journals, this is important.
- Removed old interactive plot download button and associated helper
  function.
- Removed old dynamically hidden stats download button and associated
  logic, since stats are now included in the source download when
  applicable.
- Statistic helper functions are now exported allowing users to annotate
  plotly graphs with custom statistics:
  [`compute_pairwise_stats()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/compute_pairwise_stats.md),
  [`create_stat_annotations()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/create_stat_annotations.md),
  [`apply_stat_annotations()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/apply_stat_annotations.md),
  [`generate_pair_strings()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/generate_pair_strings.md),
  and
  [`parse_pair_strings()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/parse_pair_strings.md).
- Exposed
  [`empty_plot()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/empty_plot.md)
  for use as a placeholder, e.g. if parameters aren’t valid for a given
  plot type, to pass that info to user without ugly error messages.
- Faceting improvements - new internal helpers that control subplot
  spacing, subplot size, and facet_scale handling. This fixes much of
  the wonkiness for plots with many panels. Uniform inputs added for
  panel spacing across all modules.
- Axis titles now uniformly added as annotations to allow interactive
  repositioning.
- Condensed package wide workflows with simple helpers,
  e.g. [`apply_title_layout()`](https://j-andrews7.github.io/VizModules/dev/reference/apply_title_layout.md),
  resulting in significantly less jank.
- Axis adjustments are now properly reflected in axis/legend titles for
  appropriate modules, e.g. `yPlot`, `scatterPlot`, `linePlot`.
- Removed a handful of spurious/non-functional inputs, particularly for
  the `dittoViz_scatterPlot` module.
- Custom `size.by` legends added for `plotthis_DotPlot` and
  `dittoViz_scatterPlot` modules, since plotly does not yet support
  these.
- Update docstrings to reflect new inputs and features and clarify which
  parameters of underlying plotting functions may not be implemented.
- Various border fixes for faceted plots.
